## Purpose
The **E-Commerce Base - Backend** repository provides a strong and scalable foundation for creating e-commerce platforms. By offering a prebuilt backend system with essential APIs, it helps developers and businesses save time while ensuring reliability and security.

This project is particularly helpful for:
- **Developers** seeking a ready-to-use backend with common e-commerce features.
- **Startups** that need to rapidly develop and deploy their online store backend.
- **Educators and learners** exploring backend development and API integration.
- **Businesses** transitioning into online retail, requiring a robust backend solution.

## Description
The backend system is developed with Node.js and Express, featuring modular architecture for scalability and maintainability. It includes APIs for user authentication, product management, order processing, and feedback handling, integrated with MongoDB for data storage.

## Features
- **Secure User Authentication**: User registration, login, and JWT-based authorization.
- **Product Management**: CRUD APIs for managing product catalog.
- **Order Processing**: APIs for managing shopping carts and orders.
- **Review and Feedback**: Submit and fetch product reviews and complaints.
- **Database Integration**: MongoDB for seamless data storage and retrieval.

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable backend applications.
- **Express**: Web framework for creating RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB (Mongoose)**: NoSQL database for efficient data management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install **Node.js** (v14 or later).
- Set up a **MongoDB** database (local or cloud).

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-base-backend.git
   cd ecommerce-base-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Test the API**:
   - Open your browser or use a tool like Postman to visit `http://localhost:5000`.

## Example API Endpoints
